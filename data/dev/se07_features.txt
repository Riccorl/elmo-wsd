your oct. 6 editorial `` the ill homeless `` referred to research by us and six of our colleagues that was reported in the sept. 8 issue of the journal of the american medical association .
your comments implied we had discovered that the `` principal cause `` of homelessness is to be found in the large numbers of mentally ill and substance-abusing people in the homeless population .
we have made no such statement .
it is clear that most mentally ill people and most alcoholics do not become homeless .
the `` causes `` of homelessness are poorly understood and complex in any individual case .
in quoting from our research you emphasized the high prevalance of mental illness and alcoholism .
you did not note that the homeless people we examined had a multitude of physical disorders in addition to their psychiatric problems and substance abuse .
they suffered from malnutrition , chest diseases , cardiovascular disorders , skin problems , infectious diseases and the aftereffects of assaults and rape .
homeless people not only lack safety , privacy and shelter , they also lack the elementary necessities of nutrition , cleanliness and basic health care .
in a recent report , the institute of medicine pointed-out that certain health problems may predispose a person to homelessness , others may be a consequence of it , and a third category is composed of disorders whose treatment is difficult or impossible if a person lacks adequate shelter .
the interactions between health and homelessness are complex , defying sweeping generalizations as to `` cause `` or `` effect . ``
if we look-to the future , preventing homelessness is an important objective .
this will require us to develop a much more sophisticated understanding of the dynamics of homelessness than we currently possess , an understanding that can be developed only through careful study and research .

a study by tulane prof. james wright says homelessness is due to a complex array of problems , with the common thread of poverty .
the study shows that nearly 40 % of the homeless population is made-up of women and children and that only 25 % of the homeless exhibits some combination of drug , alcohol and mental problems .
according to dr. wright , homelessness is `` simultaneously a housing problem , an employment problem , a demographic problem , a problem of social disaffiliation , a mental health problem , a family violence problem , a problem created by the cutbacks in social welfare spending , a problem resulting from the decay of the traditional nuclear family , and a problem intimately connected to the recent increase in the number of persons living below the poverty level . ``

to quote the highly regarded director of a privately funded drop-in center for the homeless in new york : `` if you 're homeless , you do n't sleep for fear of being robbed or murdered .
after your first three weeks of sleep deprivation , you 're scarcely in touch with reality any more ; without psychiatric treatment , you may well be unable to fend for yourself ever again . ``
some of the homeless , obviously , had pre-existing mental illness or addiction .
but many others have fallen through cracks in the economy into the grim , brutal world of our city streets .
once there , what ways of escape are open to them other than drink , drugs or insanity ?
maxwell r.d. vos brooklyn , n.y .
you dismiss as `` sentimental `` the view that the reduction of federal housing-assistance programs by 77 % might have played a significant role in the increased number of men and women sleeping on our city streets during the reagan-bush years .
there is no sign that you bothered to consider the inverse of your logic : namely , that mental illness and substance abuse might be to some degree consequences rather than causes of homelessness .
your research stopped when a convenient assertion could be made .
robert s. jenkins cambridge , mass .
of the approximately 200 sponsors of the recent march in washington for the homeless , you chose to cite such groups as the national association of home builders and the international union of bricklayers and allied craftsmen , insinuating that the march got its major support from self-serving groups that `` know a good thing when they see it , `` and that the crusade was based on greed or the profit motive .
but is n't the desire for profit the driving force behind those who subscribe to , and advertise in , your paper ?
why did n't you mention the ymca or the ywca or catholic charities usa or a hundred other nonprofit organizations that participated in the march ?
as for the findings on the 203 baltimore homeless who underwent psychiatric examinations , i suggest you conduct your own survey .
choose 203 business executives , including , perhaps , someone from your own staff , and put them out on the streets , to be deprived for one month of their homes , families and income .
i would predict that within a short time most of them would find thunderbird a satisfactory substitute for chivas regal and that their `` normal `` phobias , anxieties , depressions and substance abuse would increase dramatically .

`` feeding frenzy `` ( henry holt , 326 pages , $ 19.95 ) , a highly detailed account of the wedtech scandal , begins on a reassuring note .
right up front in the preface , co-author william sternberg gives us an example of his own integrity .
when offered a free trip from the bronx , wedtech 's home , to washington , d.c. , by one of wedtech 's principals , he tells the reader , `` mindful of accepting anything of value from those i was writing-about , i declined . ``
any question as to why an author would believe this plaintive , high-minded note of assurance is necessary is answered by reading this book about sticky fingers and sweaty scammers .
bribe by bribe , mr. sternberg and his co-author , matthew c. harrison jr. , lead us along the path wedtech traveled , from its inception as a small manufacturing company to the status of full-fledged defense contractor , entrusted with the task of producing vital equipment for the army and navy .
the book revolves-around john mariotta , the founder of the company , and fred neuberger , who became his partner soon after wedtech 's creation .
although started in 1965 , wedtech did n't really get rolling until 1975 , when mr. neuberger discovered the federal government 's section 8 a minority business program .
this is a johnson-era , great society creation that mandates certain government contracts be awarded noncompetitively to minority businesses .
mr. neuberger realized that , although of italian ancestry , mr. mariotta still could qualify as a minority person since he was born in puerto rico .
the two partners merely had to falsify the true ownership of the corporation .
instead of 50/50 it became , on paper only , two-thirds mariotta , one-third neuberger , and they were in the program and off to the races .
besides being a `` minority-owned company `` wedtech was located in the south bronx , a blighted area , made famous by jimmy carter in his 1976 presidential campaign .
the company plugged itself right into carter campaign rhetoric about rebuilding the south bronx and kept using the minority -- south bronx angle through the reagan '80s .
starting with congressman mario biaggi now serving a jail sentence , the company began a career of bribing federal , state and local public officials and those close to public officials , right up to and including e. robert wallach , close friend and adviser to former attorney general ed meese .
wedtech did n't just use old fashioned bribery .
it made ample use of the modern techniques of influence peddling , retaining politically connected `` respectable `` law firms , investment bankers and political consultants , including reagan confidant lyn nofzinger .
when necessary , it sought and received assistance from organized crime .
sometimes the bribed became partners in the company .
wedtech management used the merit system .
if you were especially helpful in a corrupt scheme you received not just cash in a bag , but equity .
if you were not an effective crook , you found yourself out in the cold , a fate that eventually befell mr. mariotta , the firm 's semiliterate `` minority `` person .
but despite the sensational nature of the revelations and the breezy , easy-to-read tabloid writing style , `` feeding frenzy `` often falls-short of gripping reading .
none of the scams show much ingenuity : auditors found crookery the first day on the job .
wedtech 's scammers simply bribed them to shut-up .
the scammers themselves were garden-variety low lifes , conspicuous consumers who wanted big houses , mercedes cars , beautiful women , expensive clothes .
among the lot of them , not one is wrestling with good and evil , or especially intelligent or even temporarily insane .
the one character at least somewhat interesting was irving louis lobsenz , a pediatrician who changed his name to rusty kent london and became a master gambler and author of a book on blackjack .
he enters the story toward the end , just in time to get arrested .
absorbed in doling out `` feeding frenzy 's `` tidbits , the authors gloss-over the root causes of wedtech , namely the section 8 a federal program under whose auspices the scandal took-place .
they do at least come-around to saying that the courts might want to end `` rigid affirmative action programs . ``
programs like section 8 a are a little like leaving gold in the street and then expressing surprise when thieves walk by to scoop it up .
numerous other scandals , among them the ones at hud , have the same characteristics as wedtech .
they take-place in government programs that seem tailor-made for corruption .
why are programs like this not eliminated ?
`` feeding frenzy `` does provide a few clues .
in and around all levels of government in the u.s. are groups of people who can best be described as belonging to a political insider commercial party .
they know that whenever government is redistributing wealth , regulating commerce or maintaining a large defense establishment , there is big money to be made in influencing , brokering or selling the processes and decisions of government .
they are our version of the east bloc 's nomenklatura and they have absolutely no wish to see anything change .
how many government programs and policies exist because they line the pockets of political insiders ?
this is the real issue raised by the wedtech scandal .
mr. stern was chairman and chief executive officer of the new york state urban development corp. , 1983-85 .
i had to reach back to french 101 when the monsieur avec clipboard leaned over my shoulder during the coffee phase of dinner and asked whether i wanted to ride in a montgolfiere .
i was a last-minute read interloping attendee at a french journalism convention and so far the festivities had been taken-up entirely by eating , drinking , smoking , sleeping and drinking .
the man with the clipboard represented a halfhearted attempt to introduce a bit of les sportif into our itinerary .
but as the french embody a zen-like state of blase when it comes-to athletics try finding a nautilus machine in paris , my fellow conventioners were having none of it .
the diners at my table simply lit more gauloises and scoffed at the suggestion of interrupting a perfectly good saturday morning to go golfing or even montgolfing ballooning to you ; the brothers montgolfier , french of course , were the world 's first hot-air balloonists .
back in the u.s.a. this kind of chi-chi airborne activity wins heartwarmingly covetous responses .
as in : `` you went ballooning ? ? ! !
in france ? ? ! ! ``
americans it seems have followed malcolm forbes 's hot-air lead and taken-to ballooning in a heady way .
during the past 25 years , the number of balloonists those who have passed a federal aviation authority lighter-than-air test have swelled from a couple hundred to several thousand , with some estimates running as high as 10,000 .
some 30 balloon shows are held annually in the u.s. , including the world 's largest convocation of ersatz phineas foggs -- the nine-day albuquerque international balloon fiesta that attracts some 800,000 enthusiasts and more than 500 balloons , some of which are fetchingly shaped to resemble carmen miranda , garfield or a 12-story-high condom .
the condom balloon was denied official entry status this year .
but in epinal , a gray 16th-century river town adjacent to france 's vosges mountain region , none of these yankee-come-lately enthusiasms for things aloft was evident .
ballooning at the de rigueur hour of 6 a.m. held all the attraction for most people of sunrise root-canal work .
feeling the naggings of a culture imperative , i promptly signed-up .
the first thing anybody will tell you about ballooning is that it requires zip in the way of athletic prowess , or even a measure of derring-do .
so long as you do n't look down .
they will also tell you that even if you hate heights , you can still balloon .
i still say do n't look down .
at least not when you are ascending .
what they wo n't tell you is not to go aloft in anything you do n't want to get wet .
i 'm not referring to the traditional champagne drenching during the back-on-terra-firma toast .
i 'm talking about landing in a canal .
in a porous wicker basket .
with a pilot who speaks no english .
to wit , my maiden voyage and novitiates are referred to as virgins began at dawn on a dew-sodden fairway and ended at noon in a soggy field .
balloon flights almost always occur at dawn or dusk , when the winds are lightest .
in between came lots of coffee drinking while watching the balloons inflate and lots of standing around deciding who would fly in what balloon and in what order the baskets hold no more than four passengers .
when it was n't my turn in the balloon i followed its progress from the `` chase car , `` listening to the driver holler into a walkie-talkie .
after long stretches of this attendant ground activity came 20 or so lovely minutes of drifting above the vosges watching the silver mists rise off the river and the french cows amble about the fields .
it 's hard not to feel that god 's in his heaven with this kind of bird's-eye view of the world , even if your pilote in silly plaid beret kept pointing-out how `` belle `` it all was .
eventually little french farmers and their little french farmwives came out of their stone houses and put their hands above their tiny eyes and squinted at us .
no wonder .
we were coming down straight into their canal .
see , the other rule of thumb about ballooning is that you ca n't steer .
and neither can your pilot .
you can go only up or down by heating the balloon 's air with a propane burner , which does make the top of your head feel hot and ride the air currents .
which makes the chase car necessary .
most balloonists seldom go higher than 2,000 feet and most average a leisurely 5-10 miles an hour .
when the balloon is cruising along at a steady altitude there is little sense of motion .
only when one is ascending -- or in our case descending a tad trop rapidement -- does one feel , well , airborne in a picnic basket .
`` what 's he doing ? `` hissed my companion , who was the only other english-speaking member of the convention and whose knuckles were white .
`` attention , `` yelled our pilot as our basket plunged into the canal .
`` you bet attention , `` i yelled back , leaping atop the propane tanks , `` i 'm wearing alligator loafers ! ``
our pilot simply laughed , fired up the burner and with another blast of flame lifted us , oh , a good 12-inches above the water level .
we scuttled along for a few feet before he plunged us into the drink again .
eventually we came to rest in a soggy patch of field where we had the exquisite pleasure of scrambling out of the basket into the mud while the french half of our ballooning tag team scrambled in .
i looked at my watch .
barely half-an-hour aloft .
back in the chase car , we drove around some more , got stuck-in a ditch , enlisted the aid of a local farmer to get-out the trailer hitch and pull us out of the ditch .
we finally rendezvoused with our balloon , which had come to rest on a dirt road amid a clutch of epinalers who watched us disassemble our craft -- another half-an-hour of non-flight activity -- that included the precision routine of yanking the balloon to the ground , punching all the air out of it , rolling it up and cramming it and the basket into the trailer .
it was the most exercise we 'd had all morning and it was followed by our driving immediately to the nearest watering hole .
this meant returning to the golf course , where we watched a few french duffers maul the first tee while we sat under cinzano umbrellas , me nursing an espresso and my ego .
a whole morning of ballooning and i had been off the ground barely 30 minutes .
still , i figured the event 's envy-quotient back in the u.s.a. was near peerless .
as for the ride back to camp , our pilot and all the other french-speaking passengers clambered into the chase car .
my american companion and i were left to ride alfresco in the wicker basket .
as we streaked by a blase gendarme , i could n't resist rearing up on my soggy loafers and saluting .
