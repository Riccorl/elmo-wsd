your oct. 6 editorial `` the ill homeless `` refer_wn:01024190v to research_wn:00636921n by us and six of our colleagues that was report_wn:00966809v in the sept. 8 issue of the journal of the american medical association .
your comment_wn:06765044n imply_wn:00929839v we had discover_wn:00598954v that the `` principal cause_wn:07326557n `` of homelessness is to be find_wn:02154508v in the large numbers of mentally ill and substance-abusing people in the homeless population .
we have make_wn:01755816v no such statement_wn:07203126n .
it is clear that most mentally ill people and most alcoholics do not become_wn:00149583v homeless .
the `` cause_wn:07326557n `` of homelessness are poorly understand_wn:00588888v and complex in any individual case .
in quote_wn:01023574v from our research you emphasize_wn:01013367v the high prevalance of mental illness and alcoholism .
you did not note_wn:01020005v that the homeless people_wn:07942152n we examine_wn:02131279v have_wn:00065370v a multitude_wn:13775093n of physical disorders in addition to their psychiatric problems and substance abuse .
they suffer_wn:00065639v from malnutrition , chest diseases , cardiovascular disorders , skin problems , infectious diseases and the aftereffects of assaults and rape .
homeless people_wn:07942152n not only lack_wn:02632353v safety , privacy and shelter_wn:14539960n , they also lack_wn:02632353v the elementary necessity_wn:09367203n of nutrition , cleanliness and basic health care .
in a recent report , the institute of medicine point_out_wn:01058574v that certain health problem_wn:14410605n may predispose_wn:00680692v a person_wn:00007846n to homelessness , others may be a consequence of it , and a third category_wn:07997703n is compose_wn:02621244v of disorders whose treatment is difficult or impossible if a person lack_wn:02632353v adequate shelter_wn:14539960n .
the interaction_wn:00039021n between health and homelessness are complex , defy_wn:02707800v sweeping generalization_wn:05913275n as to `` cause `` or `` effect . ``
if we look_to_wn:00720617v the future , prevent_wn:02452885v homelessness is an important objective .
this will require_wn:02627934v us to develop_wn:00545557v a much more sophisticated understanding_wn:05805475n of the dynamics of homelessness than we currently possess_wn:02632167v , an understanding that can be develop_wn:00545557v only through careful study and research .

a study_wn:07218470n by tulane prof. james wright say_wn:01016002v homelessness is due to a complex array of problems , with the common thread of poverty .
the study_wn:07218470n show_wn:00664788v that nearly 40 % of the homeless population is make_up_wn:02620587v of women and children and that only 25 % of the homeless exhibit_wn:02631856v some combination_wn:07963711n of drug , alcohol and mental problems .
according to dr. wright , homelessness is `` simultaneously a housing problem_wn:14410605n , an employment problem , a demographic problem , a problem of social disaffiliation , a mental health problem , a family violence problem , a problem create_wn:01617192v by the cutbacks in social welfare spending , a problem result_wn:02635659v from the decay of the traditional nuclear family , and a problem intimately connect_wn:00713167v to the recent increase in the number of person_wn:00007846n live_wn:02614387v below the poverty level . ``
leighton e. cluff m.d. president robert wood johnson foundation princeton , n.j .
to quote_wn:01023259v the highly regarded director_wn:10014939n of a privately funded drop-in center_wn:02993546n for the homeless in new york : `` if you 're homeless , you do n't sleep_wn:00014742v for fear of being rob_wn:02321391v or murdered .
after your first three weeks of sleep deprivation , you 're scarcely in touch with reality any more ; without psychiatric treatment , you may well be unable to fend_wn:02588122v for yourself ever again . ``
some of the homeless , obviously , have_wn:00065370v pre-existing mental illness or addiction_wn:14062725n .
but many others have fall_wn:01972298v through cracks in the economy into the grim , brutal world of our city streets .
once there , what ways of escape are open to them other than drink , drugs or insanity ?
maxwell r.d. vos brooklyn , n.y .
you dismiss_wn:00800930v as `` sentimental `` the view_wn:06208751n that the reduction_wn:00351638n of federal housing-assistance programs by 77 % might have play_wn:02370650v a significant role_wn:00720565n in the increased number_wn:05121418n of men and woman_wn:10787470n sleeping on our city streets during the reagan-bush years .
there is no sign that you bother_wn:02507464v to consider_wn:02166460v the inverse of your logic : namely , that mental illness and substance abuse might be to some degree consequences rather than causes of homelessness .
your research_wn:00636921n stop_wn:02609764v when a convenient assertion_wn:07203126n could be make_wn:01755816v .
robert s. jenkins cambridge , mass .
of the approximately 200 sponsors of the recent march_wn:08428019n in washington for the homeless , you choose_wn:00679937v to cite_wn:01024190v such group_wn:00031264n as the national association of home builders and the international union of bricklayers and allied craftsmen , insinuate_wn:00927711v that the march get_wn:02210855v its major support_wn:13365698n from self-serving groups that `` know_wn:00608502v a good thing_wn:05671325n when they see_wn:02128873v it , `` and that the crusade_wn:00798245n was base_wn:00636888v on greed or the profit motive .
but is n't the desire for profit the driving force_wn:05194578n behind those who subscribe_wn:02209745v to , and advertise_wn:00976653v in , your paper ?
why did n't you mention_wn:01024190v the ymca or the ywca or catholic charities usa or a hundred other nonprofit organization_wn:08008335n that participate_wn:02450256v in the march ?
as for the findings on the 203 baltimore homeless_wn:10182190n who undergo_wn:02108377v psychiatric examination_wn:00635850n , i suggest_wn:00875394v you conduct_wn:02445509v your own survey_wn:00644503n .
choose_wn:00674607v 203 business executive_wn:10069645n , include_wn:02632940v , perhaps , someone from your own staff , and put_wn:01494310v them out on the streets , to be deprive_wn:02313250v for one month of their homes , families and income .
i would predict_wn:00917772v that within a short time most of them would find_wn:00715239v thunderbird a satisfactory substitute for chivas regal and that their `` normal `` phobias , anxieties , depressions and substance abuse would increase_wn:00156601v dramatically .

`` feeding frenzy `` ( henry holt , 326 pages , $ 19.95 ) , a highly detailed account_wn:06514093n of the wedtech scandal , begin_wn:02608823v on a reassuring note .
right up front in the preface , co-author william sternberg give_wn:02235842v us an example_wn:05820620n of his own integrity .
when offer_wn:02297142v a free trip_wn:00308370n from the bronx , wedtech 's home , to washington , d.c. , by one of wedtech 's principals , he tell_wn:00953216v the reader_wn:10508862n , `` mindful of accept_wn:02236124v anything of value from those i was write_about_wn:01699172v , i decline_wn:02237338v . ``
any question_wn:07193596n as to why an author_wn:10794014n would believe_wn:00689344v this plaintive , high-minded note of assurance is necessary is answer_wn:00635523v by read_wn:00625119v this book_wn:06410904n about sticky fingers and sweaty scammers .
bribe by bribe , mr. sternberg and his co-author , matthew c. harrison jr. , lead_wn:01999798v us along the path_wn:00415676n wedtech travel_wn:01846916v , from its inception as a small manufacturing company_wn:08058098n to the status of full-fledged defense contractor_wn:09960688n , entrust_wn:02349212v with the task of produce_wn:01621555v vital equipment for the army and navy .
the book_wn:06410904n revolve_around_wn:02676496v john mariotta , the founder of the company , and fred neuberger , who become_wn:02626604v his partner_wn:09935434n soon after wedtech 's creation .
although start_wn:01628449v in 1965 , wedtech did n't really get_wn:00345761v roll_wn:01526139v until 1975 , when mr. neuberger discover_wn:02286687v the federal government 's section 8 a minority business programme_wn:05899087n .
this is a johnson-era , great society creation_wn:03129123n that mandate_wn:00751389v certain government contract_wn:06520944n be award_wn:02262278v noncompetitively to minority businesses .
mr. neuberger realize_wn:00728617v that , although of italian ancestry , mr. mariotta still could qualify_wn:02679012v as a minority person since he was born in puerto rico .
the two partner_wn:09935434n merely have_wn:00770437v to falsify_wn:02576921v the true ownership_wn:13240514n of the corporation .
instead of 50/50 it become_wn:02626604v , on paper only , two-thirds mariotta , one-third neuberger , and they were in the program and off to the races .
besides being a `` minority-owned company `` wedtech was locate_wn:02333689v in the south bronx , a blighted area_wn:08497294n , make_wn:00120316v famous by jimmy carter in his 1976 presidential campaign .
the company_wn:08058098n plugged itself right into carter campaign rhetoric about rebuild_wn:01655902v the south bronx and keep_wn:02684924v use_wn:02600490v the minority -- south bronx angle_wn:06211078n through the reagan '80s .
start_wn:00345761v with congressman mario biaggi now serve_wn:02709107v a jail sentence_wn:15224692n , the company_wn:08058098n begin_wn:00348746v a career_wn:00282613n of bribe_wn:02284096v federal , state and local public official_wn:10372373n and those close to public officials , right up to and include_wn:02632940v e. robert wallach , close friend and adviser to former attorney general ed meese .
wedtech did n't just use_wn:01158872v old fashioned bribery .
it make_wn:02560585v ample use_wn:00947128n of the modern techniques of influence peddling , retain_wn:02410175v politically connected `` respectable `` law firms , investment bankers and political consultants , include_wn:02632940v reagan confidant lyn nofzinger .
when necessary , it seek_wn:02240481v and receive_wn:02210119v assistance_wn:01207609n from organized crime .
sometimes the bribed become_wn:02626604v partner_wn:09935434n in the company .
wedtech management_wn:08381165n use_wn:01158872v the merit system_wn:05661996n .
if you were especially helpful in a corrupt scheme you receive_wn:02210119v not just cash in a bag , but equity_wn:13333420n .
if you were not an effective crook , you find_wn:02197781v yourself out in the cold , a fate_wn:07330007n that eventually befall_wn:00345000v mr. mariotta , the firm 's semiliterate `` minority `` person_wn:00007846n .
but despite the sensational nature of the revelations and the breezy , easy-to-read tabloid writing style , `` feeding frenzy `` often fall_short_wn:01799484v of gripping reading .
none of the scams show_wn:01015244v much ingenuity_wn:04730367n : auditors find_wn:02154508v crookery the first day on the job .
wedtech 's scammers simply bribe_wn:02284096v them to shut_up_wn:01041061v .
the scammers themselves were garden-variety low lifes , conspicuous consumers who want_wn:01825237v big houses , mercedes cars , beautiful women , expensive clothes_wn:02728440n .
among the lot of them , not one is wrestle_wn:00813495v with good and evil , or especially intelligent or even temporarily insane .
the one character at least somewhat interesting was irving louis lobsenz , a pediatrician who change_wn:00161225v his name_wn:06333653n to rusty kent london and become_wn:02626604v a master gambler and author_wn:10794014n of a book on blackjack .
he enter_wn:02016523v the story toward the end , just in time to get_wn:00149583v arrest_wn:01215137v .
absorb_wn:00600370v in doling out `` feeding frenzy 's `` tidbits , the author_wn:10794014n gloss_over_wn:02516255v the root causes of wedtech , namely the section 8 a federal program_wn:05899087n under whose auspices the scandal_wn:07306252n take_place_wn:00339934v .
they do at least come_around_wn:00654446v to say_wn:01009821v that the court_wn:08329453n might want_wn:01825237v to end_wn:00352826v `` rigid affirmative action program_wn:05899087n . ``
programs like section 8 a are a little like leave_wn:00613683v gold_wn:14638799n in the street and then express_wn:00943837v surprise_wn:07510348n when thieves walk_wn:01904930v by to scoop_wn:01312371v it up .
numerous other scandals , among them the one_wn:05870055n at hud , have_wn:02630189v the same characteristic_wn:05849789n as wedtech .
they take_place_wn:00339934v in government program_wn:05899087n that seem_wn:02133435v tailor-made for corruption .
why are program_wn:05899087n like this not eliminate_wn:00471711v ?
`` feeding frenzy `` does provide_wn:02327200v a few clue_wn:06643763n .
in and around all levels of government in the u.s. are group_wn:00031264n of people_wn:07942152n who can best be describe_wn:00987071v as belong_wn:02737569v to a political insider commercial party .
they know_wn:00594621v that whenever government_wn:08050678n is redistribute_wn:01379965v wealth_wn:13353280n , regulate_wn:02511551v commerce_wn:01090446n or maintain_wn:01184625v a large defense establishment_wn:08053576n , there is big money_wn:13250542n to be make_wn:02289295v in influence_wn:02536557v , broker_wn:02261464v or selling the processes and decision_wn:05838176n of government .
they are our version of the east bloc 's nomenklatura and they have_wn:02108026v absolutely no wish_wn:07486229n to see_wn:02128873v anything change_wn:00109660v .
how many government programs and policies exist_wn:02603699v because they line_wn:06799897n the pocket_wn:13356774n of political insiders ?
this is the real issue_wn:05814650n raise_wn:01025246v by the wedtech scandal .
mr. stern was chairman and chief executive officer of the new york state urban development corp. , 1983-85 .
i had to reach_wn:02685665v back to french 101 when the monsieur avec clipboard lean_wn:02038357v over my shoulder during the coffee phase of dinner and ask_wn:00784342v whether i want_wn:01825237v to ride_wn:01955984v in a montgolfiere .
i was a last-minute read_wn:00624476v interloping attendee at a french journalism convention and so far the festivities had been take_up_wn:02649493v entirely by eating , drinking , smoking , sleeping and drinking .
the man_wn:10287213n with the clipboard represent_wn:02620587v a halfhearted attempt_wn:00786195n to introduce_wn:01618693v a bit_wn:13761407n of les sportif into our itinerary .
but as the french embody_wn:02698443v a zen-like state_wn:00024720n of blase when it come_to_wn:02108791v athletics try_wn:02530167v find_wn:02154508v a nautilus machine_wn:03699975n in paris , my fellow conventioners were have_wn:02236124v none of it .
the diner_wn:10013242n at my table simply light_wn:01199881v more gauloises and scoff_wn:00850192v at the suggestion of interrupt_wn:00778275v a perfectly good saturday morning_wn:15165289n to go golfing or even montgolfing ballooning to you ; the brothers montgolfier , french of course , were the world 's first hot-air balloonists .
back in the u.s.a. this kind of chi-chi airborne activity win_wn:01111028v heartwarmingly covetous response_wn:07199565n .
as in : `` you went balloon_wn:01948659v ? ? ! !
in france ? ? ! ! ``
americans it seem_wn:02134672v have follow_wn:01744450v malcolm forbes 's hot-air lead_wn:01256743n and take_to_wn:02600779v ballooning in a heady way .
during the past 25 years , the number_wn:05121418n of balloonists those who have pass_wn:02525044v a federal aviation authority lighter-than-air test_wn:07197021n have swell_wn:00555084v from a couple hundred to several thousand , with some estimate_wn:05803379n run_wn:02727039v as high as 10,000 .
some 30 balloon shows are hold_wn:01733477v annually in the u.s. , include_wn:02632940v the world 's largest convocation of ersatz phineas foggs -- the nine-day albuquerque international balloon fiesta that attract_wn:01505254v some 800,000 enthusiasts and more than 500 balloon_wn:02782093n , some of which are fetchingly shape_wn:00142191v to resemble_wn:02665282v carmen miranda , garfield or a 12-story-high condom .
the condom balloon_wn:02782093n was deny_wn:02214190v official entry status_wn:13945919n this year .
but in epinal , a gray 16th-century river town adjacent to france 's vosges mountain region , none of these yankee-come-lately enthusiasms for things aloft was evident .
ballooning at the de rigueur hour of 6 a.m. hold_wn:02746275v all the attraction_wn:04688246n for most people of sunrise root-canal work .
feel_wn:02110552v the naggings of a culture imperative , i promptly sign_up_wn:01097309v .
the first thing_wn:06723908n anybody will tell_wn:00952524v you about ballooning is that it require_wn:02627934v zip_wn:05035961n in the way of athletic prowess , or even a measure of derring-do .
so long as you do n't look_wn:02130524v down .
they will also tell_wn:00952524v you that even if you hate_wn:01774136v heights , you can still balloon_wn:01948659v .
i still say_wn:01009821v do n't look_wn:02130524v down .
at least not when you are ascend_wn:01969216v .
what they wo n't tell_wn:00952524v you is not to go_wn:00149583v aloft in anything you do n't want_wn:01825237v to get_wn:00149583v wet .
i 'm not refer_wn:01024190v to the traditional champagne drenching during the back-on-terra-firma toast .
i 'm talk_wn:00962447v about landing in a canal .
in a porous wicker basket .
with a pilot_wn:10433164n who speak_wn:00963570v no english .
to wit , my maiden voyage and novitiates are refer_wn:00655555v to as virgins begin_wn:02609203v at dawn on a dew-sodden fairway and end_wn:02609764v at noon in a soggy field .
balloon flight_wn:00302394n almost always occur_wn:00339934v at dawn or dusk , when the winds are lightest .
in between come_wn:02743565v lot_wn:13774404n of coffee drinking while watch_wn:02150510v the balloon_wn:02782093n inflate_wn:00256117v and lots of stand_wn:01546111v around decide_wn:00697589v who would fly_wn:01840238v in what balloon and in what order the basket_wn:02801938n hold_wn:02701210v no more than four passengers .
when it was n't my turn in the balloon i follow_wn:00729109v its progress_wn:07445265n from the `` chase car , `` listen_wn:02169891v to the driver_wn:10034906n holler_wn:00915423v into a walkie-talkie .
after long stretches of this attendant ground activity come_wn:02743565v 20 or so lovely minute_wn:15234764n of drift_wn:01902783v above the vosges watch_wn:02150510v the silver mists rise_wn:01968569v off the river and the french cow_wn:02403454n amble_wn:01918183v about the fields .
it 's hard not to feel_wn:00715239v that god 's in his heaven with this kind of bird's-eye view of the world , even if your pilote in silly plaid beret keep_wn:02684924v point_out_wn:01058574v how `` belle `` it all was .
eventually little french farmers and their little french farmwives come_wn:01849221v out of their stone houses and put_wn:01494310v their hand_wn:05564590n above their tiny eyes and squint_wn:00008799v at us .
no wonder .
we were come_wn:01849221v down straight into their canal .
see_wn:00591115v , the other rule of thumb about ballooning is that you ca n't steer_wn:01931768v .
and neither can your pilot .
you can go_wn:01835496v only up or down by heat_wn:00371264v the balloon 's air_wn:14841267n with a propane burner_wn:02923129n , which does make_wn:00120316v the top_wn:08663860n of your head feel_wn:02730471v hot and ride_wn:02750154v the air current_wn:07406765n .
which make_wn:00120316v the chase car_wn:02958343n necessary .
most balloonists seldom go_wn:01835496v higher than 2,000 feet and most average_wn:02527294v a leisurely 5-10 miles an hour_wn:15227846n .
when the balloon_wn:02782093n is cruise_wn:01844859v along at a steady altitude there is little sense of motion .
only when one is ascend_wn:01969216v -- or in our case descend_wn:01970826v a tad trop rapidement -- does one feel , well , airborne in a picnic basket .
`` what 's he do_wn:01712704v ? `` hiss_wn:01054186v my companion_wn:09946278n , who was the only other english-speaking member of the convention and whose knuckles were white .
`` attention , `` yell_wn:00912833v our pilot_wn:10433164n as our basket_wn:02801938n plunge_wn:01977080v into the canal .
`` you bet attention , `` i yell_wn:00912833v back , leap_wn:01963942v atop the propane tanks , `` i 'm wear_wn:00052374v alligator loafer_wn:03680355n ! ``
our pilot_wn:10433164n simply laugh_wn:00031820v , fired up the burner_wn:02923129n and with another blast of flame lift_wn:01974062v us , oh , a good 12-inches above the water level .
we scuttle_wn:01902405v along for a few feet before he plunge_wn:01577093v us into the drink again .
eventually we come_wn:00542120v to rest_wn:01545883v in a soggy patch of field where we have_wn:02108026v the exquisite pleasure_wn:05829782n of scramble_wn:01921772v out of the basket into the mud while the french half_wn:13736799n of our ballooning tag team scramble_wn:01921772v in .
i look_wn:02130524v at my watch .
barely half-an-hour aloft .
back in the chase car , we drive_wn:01930117v around some more , get_wn:00149583v get_stuck_wn:01834896v a ditch , enlist_wn:02240151v the aid_wn:01207609n of a local farmer_wn:10078806n to get_out_wn:01214597v the trailer hitch_wn:03522863n and pull_out_wn:01351170v us out of the ditch .
we finally rendezvous_wn:02487226v with our balloon_wn:02782093n , which had come_wn:00542120v to rest_wn:01545883v on a dirt road amid a clutch of epinalers who watch_wn:02150510v us disassemble_wn:01657977v our craft_wn:03125870n -- another half-an-hour of non-flight activity_wn:00407535n -- that include_wn:02632940v the precision routine_wn:01026482n of yank_wn:01592072v the balloon to the ground , punch_wn:01415285v all the air_wn:14841267n out of it , roll_up_wn:01487008v it up and cram_wn:01612295v it and the basket_wn:02801938n into the trailer .
it was the most exercise_wn:00624738n we 'd have_wn:02108026v all morning and it was follow_wn:02720354v by our drive_wn:01930117v immediately to the nearest watering hole .
this mean_wn:02635189v return_wn:02004874v to the golf course , where we watch_wn:02150510v a few french duffer_wn:10039271n maul_wn:01232098v the first tee_wn:08661277n while we sit_wn:01543123v under cinzano umbrellas , me nursing an espresso and my ego_wn:07508806n .
a whole morning of ballooning and i had been off the ground barely 30 minutes .
still , i figure_wn:00712135v the event 's envy-quotient back in the u.s.a. was near peerless .
as for the ride back to camp , our pilot and all the other french-speaking passengers clamber_wn:01921772v into the chase car .
my american companion and i were leave_wn:00613683v to ride_wn:01955984v alfresco in the wicker basket .
as we streak_wn:02087605v by a blase gendarme , i could n't resist_wn:01116585v rear_wn:01981623v up on my soggy loafers and salute_wn:00899956v .
